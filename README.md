# revamped-sr-analysis
Revamped analysis of Szuwalski et al. 2015 with recent data from RAM Legacy Stock Assessment database. We are interested in the number of stocks that have recruitment positively correlated with spawning biomass. Also, we examined if the presence and duration of recruitment regimes was correlated with the stock species' lifespan.
